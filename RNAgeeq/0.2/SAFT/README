0 - Information about SAFT
================================================================================

SAFT is the abbreviation for Simple Alignment Filtering Tool and was developed
by Andre Kahles at the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society
in 2010 and 2011.

Version: 0.1 (alpha) - 2011.04.15

================================================================================
1 - Installation and Dependencies
================================================================================

BioPython
---------
For the correct parsing of GFF3 file SAFT relies on BioPython. BioPython is
available at www.biopython.org/
Please make sure, that BioPython is available in your PYTHONPATH.

SAMtools
--------
If you want to use BAM files as input, you need a working version of SAMtools
(>= 0.1.7a) available in your PATH.
You can download SAMtools from http://samtools.sourceforge.net/

SAFT
----
To install SAFT, download the latest archive from
http://www.fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/srm-eval/SAFT

Move the archive to a place of choice and unpack it. The directory
SAFT-{VERSION} will be automatically created.

You are ready to run SAFT :)

2 - Description of the single tools
================================================================================

Following tools are available:
    2.1 - (a) filter_alignment.py
        - (b) filter_features.py
    2.2 - (a) gen_intronlist_from_annotation.py
        - (b) get_intron_features.py
    2.3 - evaluate_features.py
    2.4 - find_optimal_param_set.py

2.1 - (a) filter_alignment.py
-----------------------------

This tool filters a given SAM file according to specified filtering criteria. 
You can either pipe a SAM file into the script or provide an input file. Output
can be written to stdout or a given file. By default the output file is modified
version of the input name, tagged with the filtering criteria.

To specify filtering criteria you can choose between maximal mismatches, min
exon length (which is the minimal segment length of spliced reads), a maximal
intron length, or features such as the clipping state.

You can also filter spliced alignments according to a given minimal alignment
support. Therefore you need to generate the intron features of your alignment
(see section 2.2(b)) and filter them with the support criteria unsing
filter_features.py (see section 2.1(b)). You can then use this filtered version
of the feature file for only keeping those spliced alignments given in the file
by using command line option -i.

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python filter_alignment.py
to print the usage screen.

2.1 - (b) filter_features.py
----------------------------

The script filters a given feature list according to given criteria. Only by
using this script you can later filter according to minimal splice site coverage
with filter_alignment.py (see section 2.1(a)). 

To create the feature list of an alignment, you can run get_intron_features.py
(section 2.2(b)).

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python filter_features.py
to print the usage screen.


2.2 - (a) gen_intronlist_from_annotation.py
-------------------------------------------

This tool generate the internal intron representation of annotated introns from
any given annotation in GFF3 format. You only have to specify the path to the
annotation file using the option -a and an output file via the option -o.

The script requires BioPython to be available in the PYTHONPATH. Please use
section 1 of this file for further information.

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python gen_intronlist_from_annotation.py
to print the usage screen.

2.2 - (b) get_intron_features.py
--------------------------------

With this script you can extract the intron positions together with descriptive
alignment features into a so called feature-file.

You only need to specify an input alignment in SAM or BAM format using the
option -a and the output destination using -o. If the input is BAM you must
switch the input type using -b. For BAM input you further need
SAMtools installed (see section 1). You either need SAMtools in your PATH or you
have to provide the -s option.

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python get_intron_features.py
to print the usage screen.

2.3  - evaluate_features.py
-----------------------------

This script evaluates the agreement of a given alignment to a given annotation
that is represented as an intron list. First you need to generate the intron
list (see section 2.2a) and the alignment feature file (section 2.2b).

With the option -i you can choose what annotation intron list to use and with -f
you provide the alignment feature file. 

Additionally, you can filter the evaluated features by many different criteria
as maximal mismatches or intron length. You can also restrict the evaluation to
several chromosomes/conttigs or to specific introns.

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python evaluate_features.py
to print the usage screen.

2.4  - find_optimal_param_set.py
--------------------------------

This script performs an exhaustive search over the three parameters coordinates 
 * max mismatches           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 * min segment length       [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
 * min intron read support  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

The tested values for each criterion are currently hard coded and are written in
brackets behind the criterion. If you want to change them manually, just search 
for the term "SEARCH SPACE" in find_optimal_param_set.py.

As for the feature evaluation: with the option -i you can choose what annotation
intron list to use and with -f you provide the alignment feature file.

You further need to define two output files
    -b , --best_score   the file to store the best scoring parameters
    -m , --matrix       the file to store all test parameter combinations

Further details are written in the usage screen of the script. Just type
    python find_optimal_param_set.py
to print the usage screen.

3 - Description of the pipeline
================================================================================

For intron agreement evaluation, you would need following pipeline:

    Data preparation
        ==> gen_intronlist_from_annotation.py 
        (==> filter_alignment.py -- optional)
        ==> get_intron_features.py 
    Evaluation:
        ==> evaluate_features.py

To find the optimal filter setting, you would need following pipeline:

    Data preparation:
        ==> gen_intronlist_from_annotation.py 
        ==> get_intron_features.py 
    Search:
        ==> find_optimal_param_set.py
        (==> filter_alignment.py -- optional)


================================================================================
4 - Examples
================================================================================

Example pipelines are provided as bash scripts and can be adapted.

Intron agreement evaluation:
    evaluate_alignment.sh

Find optimal filter setting:
    optimal_filter_set.sh
