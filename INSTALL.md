#### Before using oqtans package, 

##### Run

bash [./oqtans_make.sh](https://github.com/ratschlab/oqtans_tools/blob/master/oqtans_make.sh) all 

to compile all needed software components of oqtans tools.

##### Include the content of 

[tool_conf.xml.oqtans](https://github.com/ratschlab/oqtans_tools/blob/master/tool_conf.xml.oqtans) into your GALAXY tool_conf.xml file 

and SEE the [README](https://github.com/ratschlab/oqtans_tools/blob/master/README.md) file for integrating built-in genome reference index to the tools.

Source [oqtans/oqtans_config.sh](https://github.com/ratschlab/oqtans/blob/master/oqtans_config.sh) and restart galaxy instace.

Now you should be able to use oqtans with or without your GALAXY instance.
